# Seroprevalence for LASV in rodents trapped in Eastern Province, Sierra Leone.

**IN PROGRESS**

## Rodent trapping

The main pipeline for the pre-processing of caught rodents, including, speciation and habitat can be found in the linked [rodent_trapping](https://github.com/DidDrog11/rodent_trapping) repository.

## ELISA protocol

The lab protocol has been minimally adapted for use in Sierra Leone from the providers published protocol [BLACKBOX protocol](https://www.european-virus-archive.com/sites/default/files/detection_kit/LASV_IgG_IFU_11Feb2022.pdf). The protocol used is available within this repository.
